                            Way back in 2013, we had the vision to create a world of affordable travel. Destiny had presented us with the golden opportunity to explore new avenues in tourism and hence the idea of Veena World was conceived. We assembled a great team, they worked together and the work flowed throughout almost effortlessly. Our first branch office was inaugurated on 18th June 2013 but the very seed was sown rather the idea of Veena World was conceived on 1st April 2013.This date marked an exciting new day in the history of tourism.
